TASK 1 — Score each article on a scale from 0.0 (pure opinion/editorial) to 1.0 (pure factual analysis).
Consider: use of loaded language, presence of verifiable facts, attribution, emotional framing.

TASK 2 — Extract the "Factual Core": 3-5 bullet points that ALL sources appear to agree on, regardless of framing.
These should be verifiable facts, not interpretations.

TASK 3 — Write a 2-sentence "Framing Contrast" that explains how left-leaning vs right-leaning sources frame this story differently. Be specific and neutral in your own tone.
